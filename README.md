## Implementation

In this rendering framework, I implemented Stochastic progressive photon mapping (SPPM), kd-tree based bracketing box intersection acceleration, parametric surface intersection algorithm, depth of field, mapping, anti-aliasing, motion blur, highlighting and other rendering algorithms, and used openMP to implement acceleration.

There is a Chinese version report which describes the code implementation in details.
